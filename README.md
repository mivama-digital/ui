# @mivama/ui

Shared Mivama design tokens and React UI primitives for websites, portals, and product surfaces. Complete shadcn/ui distribution with exactly 64 official components and no proprietary React extensions, built on Base UI 1.7.0.

## Installation

Applications install `@mivama/ui` directly as a pre-built, tree-shakeable package from npm. You do not need to copy and paste code via the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npm install @mivama/ui
```

## Quick start

```tsx
import { Button } from "@mivama/ui/button"
import { Toaster } from "@mivama/ui/toast"
import "@mivama/ui/styles.css"

export function AppShell({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <div data-mivama-theme="product">
      {children}
      <Toaster />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Theming and density are applied directly via `data-mivama-theme` and `data-density` shell attributes or classes. Overlays (Dialog, Sheet, Drawer, Popover, Tooltip) render into portals with optional custom `container` props.

Frequently used modules can bypass the root barrel using clean subpath imports:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@mivama/ui/button"
import { Card } from "@mivama/ui/card"
import { Field } from "@mivama/ui/field"
import { Input } from "@mivama/ui/input"
import { DataTable } from "@mivama/ui/data-table"
import { ChartContainer } from "@mivama/ui/chart"
```

- For migrating from prior Mivama releases, see [`docs/migration/shadcn-compatible-release.md`](docs/migration/shadcn-compatible-release.md).
- The authoritative public module and stylesheet catalog is generated from the component registry and package export map in [`docs/generated/exports.md`](docs/generated/exports.md). Do not maintain a second export inventory in this README.

## Component documentation

Storybook is the canonical interactive usage surface. Every entry in `config/components.mjs` must have a matching story; CI enforces registry-to-story coverage.

```bash
npm run storybook
```

TypeScript and API Extractor remain the public API contract. Storybook documents usage and composition; it does not maintain a second hand-written prop schema.

## Styling and themes

Import `@mivama/ui/styles.css` once for the canonical aggregate stylesheet. It contains the self-hosted Onest variable font, Tailwind utilities, tokens, themes, and component styles.

Advanced consumers may import the lower-level stylesheets explicitly:

```ts
import "@mivama/ui/tokens.css"
import "@mivama/ui/themes.css"
```

When importing them separately, load tokens before themes and include the component styles needed by the application.

Themes and density are applied via HTML attributes or CSS classes on the application container or root element:

```html
<main data-mivama-theme="portal" data-density="compact" class="dark">...</main>
```

Supported themes are `product`, `editorial`, and `portal`. Supported densities are `comfortable` and `compact`. The root stylesheet defaults to product/comfortable so a consumer still has a complete zero-configuration base theme.

For the editorial palette, use `data-mivama-theme="editorial"`:

```tsx
<div data-mivama-theme="editorial">
  <section className="space-y-4">
    <Heading variant="statement" tone="inherit">
      Clear systems. Useful outcomes.
    </Heading>
    <Button variant="inverse">Start a project</Button>
  </section>
</div>
```

The old `.mivama-editorial-theme` class remains only as a v3 compatibility alias. New code must use `data-mivama-theme="editorial"`; removal of the alias is tracked for v4 in issue #59.

## Design tokens

The package owns shared color, layout, typography, shape, focus, density, shadow, and motion contracts. Prefer semantic tokens over application-local copies.

Common groups include:

- layout: `--page-gutter`, `--layout-gap`, `--content-stack`, `--card-grid-gap`
- surfaces/text: `--background`, `--foreground`, `--surface`, `--surface-elevated`, `--card`, `--popover`
- actions: `--primary`, `--secondary`, `--accent`, `--destructive`, `--success`, `--warning`
- controls: `--muted`, `--border`, `--border-strong`, `--input`, `--ring`, `--focus-ring`, `--overlay`
- motion/elevation: `--shadow-*`, `--motion-duration-*`, `--motion-easing-*`, `--motion-distance-*`
- sidebar: `--sidebar*`
- shape: `--shape-*`
- spacing/density: `--space-1` through `--space-12`, `--panel-padding`, `--control-height`, `--sidebar-row-height`
- typography: `--type-*`, `--font-heading`, `--font-sans`

Tailwind exposes the maintained semantic color utilities such as `bg-surface`, `bg-surface-elevated`, `border-border-strong`, and `bg-overlay`. Keep foreground/background overrides at WCAG AA contrast.

## Layout and typography

Use standard Tailwind flex/grid utilities and semantic HTML for layout structure.

Use `Heading`, `Text`, and `Eyebrow` for shared typography roles. The visual role is independent from the rendered element:

```tsx
<Heading render={<h1 />} variant="display">
  A clear proposition
</Heading>
<Text variant="lead">Supporting context for the page.</Text>
```

Use `tone="inherit"` when text should inherit the foreground color of a brand or instrument surface.

## Forms

`Field`, `FieldLabel`, `FieldDescription`, `FieldError`, `Fieldset`, and `FieldLegend` provide semantic composition without taking control of consumer IDs.

Official form controls include `Input`, `Textarea`, `Checkbox`, `RadioGroup`, `Select`, `NativeSelect`, `Switch`, and `Slider`. Consumers retain full control of `htmlFor`, `aria-describedby`, and `aria-invalid`.

```tsx
<Field>
  <FieldLabel htmlFor="region">Region</FieldLabel>
  <NativeSelect id="region" aria-describedby="region-help">
    <option value="eu">Europe</option>
  </NativeSelect>
  <FieldDescription id="region-help">
    Used to route your enquiry.
  </FieldDescription>
</Field>
```

## Accessibility

Normal controls use a minimum 44px interaction target. `xs` and `icon-xs` are reserved for intentionally dense desktop interfaces and should not be used for primary, navigation, or touch actions.

`Button` accepts `loading` to preserve dimensions, set `aria-busy`, and prevent repeated activation while work is pending.

Give `Switch` and `Progress` an accessible name with `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`. Keep the actual link or button inside an `interactive` Card; the card variant is visual, not a replacement semantic control.

Built-in labels on Dialog, Sheet, Pagination, Breadcrumb, and Sidebar primitives are localizable through their public props.

The package includes functional keyboard/focus contracts, reduced-motion/contrast/forced-colors/RTL coverage, Axe scans for maintained high-risk states, and targeted visual regression baselines.

## Motion

Transitions and animations use CSS tokens (`--motion-duration-*`, `--motion-easing-*`) with strict accessibility support. Media query `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` automatically disables non-essential animations across all components.

Consumer-owned animation should respect reduced-motion preferences rather than relying only on the package fallback.

## Development

Install dependencies without lifecycle scripts and run the canonical verification pipeline:

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run verify
```

`npm run verify` includes linting, formatting, source/workflow audits, registry and Storybook coverage, type checking, package build, API checks, bundle budgets, runtime/contract coverage, packed-package validation, Publint, and Are The Types Wrong checks.

Browser compatibility is covered separately by Playwright across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Consumer CI validates React 19, Vite, Next.js App Router, SSR imports, and tree shaking using the packed package contract. React >=19 is required.

## Registry sync

`config/components.mjs` is the canonical component inventory. `components.json` pins the official `base-nova` shadcn preset.

After adding or refreshing a component with the shadcn CLI, normalize imports and verify the repository:

```bash
npx shadcn@4.15.0 add button --overwrite
npm run sync:imports
npm run verify
```

Do not create a second component list for Storybook, documentation, or exports. Registry coverage and generated docs are derived from the canonical inventory/package map.

## Local packed consumer workflow

The consumer checks normally create the package archive themselves through the shared package-source helper. For an external consumer that deliberately vendors the current v3 archive, the equivalent manual flow is:

```bash
consumer=/absolute/path/to/consumer
mkdir -p "$consumer/vendor"
npm run verify
archive=$(npm pack --ignore-scripts --pack-destination "$consumer/vendor")
npm install --prefix "$consumer" "$consumer/vendor/$archive"
npm --prefix "$consumer" run verify
```

Commit the consumer manifest/lockfile and archive together. Do not maintain a second custom packaging script for a consumer; use npm pack or the repository's shared consumer runners.

During active development, a local consumer may reference the repository's packed archive via a `file:` dependency. Re-pack and reinstall after package changes.

## Releases

Changesets are the only release-intent/versioning format. Publishing has one canonical entrypoint: the OIDC-backed GitHub `Release` workflow. Do not publish from a feature branch or add a long-lived npm write-token fallback.

After a real publish, run the `Registry Release Probe` for the exact published version. It reuses the same Vite/Next/SSR/tree-shaking consumer logic against npm and verifies provenance/signatures.

Maintainer instructions live in [`docs/maintainers/releases.md`](docs/maintainers/releases.md).

## Migration history

Current usage belongs in this README and Storybook. Historical v3 upgrade guidance is kept separately in [`docs/migrations/v3.md`](docs/migrations/v3.md) so compatibility notes do not become recommended current architecture.
